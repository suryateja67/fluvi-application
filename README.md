## FastAPI Application

This FastAPI application serves as a comprehensive platform to manage user accounts and jokes. It provides robust APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, tailored for authenticated users. The key features include:

User Management: Allows users to create, edit, and delete their accounts seamlessly.

Joke Management: Enables users to add, retrieve, update, and delete jokes with ease.

Automated Joke Fetching: Integrates with an external joke API to fetch and store a new joke every minute automatically. This ensures the joke database is continuously enriched with fresh content.

This application is designed to be simple to set up and highly interactive through FastAPIâ€™s built-in documentation tools.

Note: 1. Only the creator of joke can delete the user
      2. If user edits his email, he needs to login and get token again using the updated email.
      3. Passing token is needed for every API.
